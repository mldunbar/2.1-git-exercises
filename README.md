# git exercises

This assignment was completed during week 2 of The Iron Yard and the purpose was to learn more about git.

The original assignment can be found here: https://github.com/TIY-GVL-FEE-2015-May/assignments/tree/master/2.1-git-exercises


There is a gh-pages branch, but it serves only to demonstrate a basic git knowledge.
